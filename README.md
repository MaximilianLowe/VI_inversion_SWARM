# VI_inversion_SWARM

This GitHub repository contains the python code to prepare and evaluate “variation of information” joint inversion of gravity and magnetic data to recover density and susceptibility distribution for the NERC funded SWARM project led by Dr. Tom Jordan. 
The resulting datasets are published through the UK Polar data centre (coming). The research article related to this reposerorty is submitted to JGR Solid Earth priprint (coming)
